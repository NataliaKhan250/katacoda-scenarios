In this step, we will pull & setup a Conjur OSS. 
It will take a few moments

```
cd conjur
./setupConjur.sh 
```{{execute HOST1}}

Conjur has been setup for you.
Let's make sure it is up and running by accessing the web interface
Please wait for a moment if it doesn't display "Your Conjur server is running!"
