TODO: Automate this

In this step, we will pull & setup a Conjur OSS. 
It will take a moments

```
cd conjur
./setupConjur.sh https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
```{{execute HOST1}}

Once it's done, let's move back to the parent folder:

`cd ..`{{execute HOST1}}
